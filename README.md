# Sentiment-Analysis-R-
This is a function I wrote in R of sentiment analysis. 
positive.txt contains all words of positive attitudes and negative.txt with negative ones.\\
This function / project was completed in Nov 2017 when I was working for Seowon (Joseph) Shin, a PhD candidate of Michael G. Foster School of Business. The original purpose of that project was to analyze tweets about unicorn companies before and after  their announcement of being unicorn. The part I did was analyzing tweets with hash tag #23andMe. Although I no longer work for him any more, I will not release the data of #23andMe here, and I will not show my codes of my complete analysis. But after all, this is a fun experience for me, and I chose to upload my codes of sentiment analysis to git.
